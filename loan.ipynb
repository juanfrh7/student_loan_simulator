    "# Finding the Optimal Split Between BSc and MSc Loans\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook analyzes the optimal way to repay two student loans — one for a BSc degree and one for an MSc degree — using a fixed total monthly payment. The objective is to minimize the total repayment time and/or the total interest paid by experimenting with different ways to split the payment between the two loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "We simulate concurrent repayment, where any leftover payment from one loan (once paid off) is reallocated to the other. The notebook includes two main approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fixed payments scenario** – where we simulate repayment of each loan separately.\n",
    "2. **Dynamic optimization scenario** – where we try various payment splits to find the best strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loan Parameters and Setup for Simulation**\n",
    "\n",
    "We define:\n",
    "- Total monthly payment capacity.\n",
    "- Loan principals and interest rates for BSc and MSc loans.\n",
    "- Monthly interest rates derived from annual interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the best way to split the payment, we iterate over possible BSc allocations (`payment_bsc`) and derive the corresponding MSc amount. We simulate each configuration and retain the one with the lowest number of repayment months (with a fallback option to compare interest paid).\n",
    "\n",
    "Important constraints:\n",
    "- Monthly payment to each loan must be greater than its monthly interest — otherwise, the principal will never decrease."
